                "<<PLACEHOLDER>> text and replace it.\n"
                "2. DO NOT invent new LaTeX commands (e.g., do not use \\faEnvelopeO "
                "or \\faLinkedinSquare, as they are not defined in the template's "
                "fontawesome5 package). Use only the commands explicitly defined "
                "or standard LaTeX text formatting.\n"
                "3. CRITICAL: Escape LaTeX special characters! &, %, $, #, _, "
                "{{ and }} must be prefixed with a backslash (e.g., \\&).\n"
                "4. CRITICAL: Do NOT put backslashes in front of normal text! "
